\section{Introduction}

This is the introduction. The following sections contain all the rules as provided by the Galactic Guide and Rules of Play, except for the last section \ref{sec:changes}, which contains all the modification to the stated rules. Metric refers to the points given for implementing the rule. Blah blah blah.

%Intention must be of one of two types in combat: “kill” and “capture”. [12.3]  \\
%
%There is a two column shift to the left for capture combat. [12.5]  \\
%
%If the attacker announces capture combat, the differential is shifted two to the left. [12.6] \\
%
%The decision to capture or kill applies to all rounds of combat [12.8] \\
%
%The capture occurs after all wounds have been assigned. [12.8]
%
%If a character is captured, the character is chosen randomly from all active characters. [12.8]
%
%A unit must be assigned to guard the captured character. [12.81]
%
%The captured character must be moved with a unit. [12.81]
%
%If the captured character is guarded by an enemy character, that guarding character cannot perform missions. [12.81]
%
%If the captured character is guarded by an enemy military unit, that military unit is unaffected. [12.81] 
%
%The captured character never contributes anything to enemy units. [12.81]
%
%The captured character can be moved at any time during the movement phase to any other character or military unit in the same environ. [12.81]
%
%A captured character unit can be freed by executing the “Free Prisoners” mission. [12.82]
%
%A captured character unit can also be freed if the captured character is not stacked with any enemy units at any time. [12.82]
%
%If the capturing force is eliminated in the same combat, the character is not considered captured. [12.83]
%
%If a character is captured and combat is still being resolved, the captured character contributes nothing to either side. [12.84]
%
%A player may only declare capture at the beginning of combat and if he is the attacker. [12.85]
%
%The * on the combat results table are ignored during kill type combat. [12.86]
%
%If during the action event, “Coup Mission aborted”, or the failure to complete an “Assassination” mission, there are no enemy units in the same environ, the characters are not captured. [12.87]
